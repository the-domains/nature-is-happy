## Nature is happy.

_But in us this is rare_

_too many forces trying to compete:_

_who has within a spring-time to prepare?_

_Who knows to shine, whom makes the rain complete?_

_Who has a heart through which the wind can wail_

_Who holds the birds' flights inwardly?_

_Who is at once so supple and so frail_

_as any branch on any single tree?_

_Who leaps like water down its inclination_

_to unknown happiness, so pure, so free?_

_Who climbs with such a lack of ostentation,_

_and keeps so high, just like a meadow-way?_
