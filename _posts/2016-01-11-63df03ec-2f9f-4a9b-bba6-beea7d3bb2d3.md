Nature is happy.

But in us this is rare

too many forces trying to compete:

who has within a spring-time to prepare?

Who knows to shine, whom makes the rain complete?

Who has a heart through which the wind can wail

Who holds the birds' flights inwardly?

Who is at once so supple and so frail

as any branch on any single tree?

Who leaps like water down its inclination

to unknown happiness, so pure, so free?

Who climbs with such a lack of ostentation,

and keeps so high, just like a meadow-way?
