My philosophy

Nature is happy - the first time I read the poem from Rilke I was somehow touched - and puzzled. Nature is happy? Yes! And no. I mean, is that really true?

When I walk through the forest here at Sk√§rva in Sweden, nothing in my ear than the wispering of the hundred year old oaks, the gentle waves of the baltic sea touching some huge rocks and a few small birds that are dancing around me - then yes. Then I do not know it, I feel it. At least I get a glimpse of that happiness. 

Later however, back to reality  (whatever that is), I read about how draughts are connected to the refugee crisis, how many natural boundaries we have already crossed and the thousands of animals we have distinguished - and I can almost feel the affect of climate change on my bare skin, the suffering of nature - and people...

The deep disconnect between people and nature is one of the causes of our worldwide crisis, as Otto Scharmer puts it. It feels like, we have lost our roots, lost our feeling for belonging, for being home, here, on this planet. At least the knowledge of how to live here in accordance to nature, seems to have vanished. 

However, in my opinion, it is not enough to learn how to live a sustainable life, just with our brains. It is not enough - or maybe makes it worse - to get rules and act out of fear and scarcity. It is not even enough to reduce our carbon emissions by half...

We just need to sit down. Here, on the ground. On this beautiful, bare stones, or grass or soil. And get touched. Let nature touch us. Slowly. Silently. Breathing and smelling the fresh air of spring, the heavy air of summer... Being fascinated again by the filigree patterns of a small green leave. Feeling the grace and wisdom of a 300 year old oak tree - and the endlessness of the sea...

And we will feel alive. Feel, this innocent and bold and humble happiness of nature. And know what to do...

And by that - this is my assumption, we will learn again what it means to live as humans, as nature, on this planet. By being connected again with nature, with others and ourselves, we will by itself be and act more and more sustainable again.
